# KeyChomp

Idk what to call this exactly. The main focus of this split keyboard is to eliminate the microcontroller area to make keyboards look sleeker. This requires more room underneath the keyboard and so tenting is necessary to hold the battery.

Specification:
- Split in 2 halves
- Bluetooth low energy
- nRF52 family BLE chips
- On board SMD components
- No Nice!Nano to save space
- No center microcontroller area
- Battery underneath tenting

I'm still planning how this will work.
There will be a few keyboard variations made:
- Cherry MX
- Kailh choc
- Kailh choc mini
- Scissor switch ???

The main focus is the Kailh choc board
